# Elevate-Labs-Task-3
I used PowerBI to analyze and visualize the sales data of a cafe. I included key points such as total revenue, top selling products, etc.. and also provided Business insights in order to help the company grow.

# ðŸ“Š Cafe Sales Analysis â€“ Business Insights

## 1. Top Performing Products
- **Salads (6.4K sales)** and **Sandwiches (4.8K)** are the leading contributors.  
- These items should be highlighted in promotions, combos, or loyalty offers to further boost performance.  

**ðŸ‘‰ Action:**  
- Launch **combo deals** (e.g., Salad + Juice, Sandwich + Coffee) to increase average ticket size.  

---

## 2. Low Performing Products
- **Cookies (1.2K)** and **Tea (1.7K)** have relatively low sales.  
- Issues may be related to **pricing, quality, or visibility**.  

**ðŸ‘‰ Action:**  
- Bundle cookies with coffee/tea to drive sales.  
- Improve product presentation or introduce new flavors.  

---

## 3. Order Types
- Sales are almost evenly split between **In-store (13.5K)** and **Takeaway (14.1K)**.  
- Both segments show strong potential for growth.  

**ðŸ‘‰ Action:**  
- Improve **takeaway packaging & promotions** for busy professionals.  
- Introduce **in-store loyalty points/offers** to retain dine-in customers.  

---

## 4. Monthly Trends
- Sales remain consistent (~2.2Kâ€“2.4K/month), with a noticeable **dip in May (1.8K)**.  
- Lack of seasonal spikes shows untapped potential for **festive or seasonal promotions**.  

**ðŸ‘‰ Action:**  
- Introduce **summer specials** (smoothies, cold coffee) during low months.  
- Run **festival/holiday campaigns** to increase sales during peak times.  

---

## 5. Payment Modes
- Customers use **Cash, Credit Card, and Digital Wallets**, but no breakdown is available.  
- Knowing the most popular method can optimize targeted promotions.  

**ðŸ‘‰ Action:**  
- If **digital wallet usage is rising**, collaborate with wallet providers for **cashback offers**.  
- Offer **credit card-linked discounts** for frequent customers.  

---

## 6. Customer Experience
- Current **average rating is 3.5/5**, which is moderate.  
- This impacts **customer trust and repeat purchases**.  

**ðŸ‘‰ Action:**  
- Collect feedback on low-rated orders (taste, service speed, packaging).  
- Enhance **staff training** and maintain quality standards to improve ratings towards **4+**.
